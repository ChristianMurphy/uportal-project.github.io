## Attendees

Jim Helwig, Christian Cousquer, Benito Gonzalez, Julien Gribonvald, Chris Beach

## Topics

### uPSC task review

The committee reviewed outstanding tasks from the previous meeting and created Github issues to track them.

### Content Management Systems and uPortal

The committee discussed a growing need for static content creators to be able to easily create content that can be displayed in uPortal. The existing Simple Content Portlet does not meet the growing needs. There is an effort to determine what the community needs are with an eye towards prototyping a possible solution.
